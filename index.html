      <h3>Why Hunza?</h3>
      <h1>Hunza Valley, Heaven on Earth</h1>
      <p>
        The valley surrounding the Hunza River is home to some of the worldâ€™s best treks, with trail lengths ranging
        from a few
        hours to several days. Combine nature with history with a steep walk up to the 800-year-old Baltit Fort, and
        hire a tour
        operator to help you explore the magical villages, interact with the hospitable locals, and score the freshest
        apricots
        in the valley. Hunza Valley is exceptionally beautiful during the cherry blossom season in spring and for the
        changing
        colors of fall. Summer is rainy season and winter can get quite cold.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Hunza people, who live in the Hunza Valley in Northern Pakistan, are among groups of long-lived people
        around the
        world. In the early 1970s, National Geographic ran an extensive series of articles investigating claims of these
        long-lived people.

        As a result, the Hunza people and region became fascinating case studies on health and longevity. They remain so
        today
        as people seek ways to boost their own health and live longer lives.
