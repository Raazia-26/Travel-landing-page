        <h3>Why Hunza?</h3>
        <h1>Hunza Valley, Heaven on Earth</h1>
        <p>
          The valley surrounding the Hunza River is home to some of the world’s best treks, with trail lengths ranging
          from a few
          hours to several days. Combine nature with history with a steep walk up to the 800-year-old Baltit Fort, and
          hire a tour
          operator to help you explore the magical villages, interact with the hospitable locals, and score the freshest
          apricots
          in the valley. Hunza Valley is exceptionally beautiful during the cherry blossom season in spring and for the
          changing
          colors of fall.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hunza people, who live in the Hunza Valley in Northern Pakistan, are among groups of long-lived people
          around the
          world.

          As a result, the Hunza people and region became fascinating case studies on health and longevity. They remain
          so
          today
          as people seek ways to boost their own health and live longer lives.

            <h4>Café De Hunza</h4>
            <p>A very famous cafe with a nice ambience and known for their walnut cake and coffee.</p>
            <h5>Address</h5>
            <p>Karimabad Karimabad Bazaar, Hunza 15700 Pakistan</p>
            <h5>What I like about it</h5>
            <p>A small cafe close to the local bazar near Baltit Fort, a self serving place that offers the best Walnut
              Cake ever. We
              tried walnut cakes at many places in Hunza but the one this cafe served was way beyond amazing. They had
              nice ice teas
              but you can find that elsewhere.
